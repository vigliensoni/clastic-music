This is a daily updated log for the current research I'm doing on the creative affordances of machine learning in the context of music production and performance. 

Some of the topics I am interested are:

- Neural synthesis
- Modeling of rhythms
- Build useful and expressive systems for musical performance
- Training data: Working and making sense of small data and the challenges of large data
